# ADR-016: AI-Powered Conversation Analysis

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the Claude Nexus Proxy processes increasing volumes of conversations, users need insights into conversation patterns, quality, and outcomes. Currently, users must manually review conversations to understand:

- Conversation effectiveness and quality
- Common user patterns and pain points
- Task completion rates and efficiency
- Areas for improvement in AI interactions

Manual analysis is time-consuming and doesn't scale. We need an automated system to analyze conversations and provide actionable insights using AI models.

## Decision Drivers

- **Scalability**: Must handle analyzing thousands of conversations efficiently
- **Flexibility**: Support multiple AI models (Gemini, Claude, etc.)
- **Performance**: Background processing to avoid impacting proxy performance
- **Cost Control**: Manage API costs through smart batching and caching
- **Privacy**: Ensure conversation data remains secure during analysis
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new analysis types and metrics

## Considered Options

1. **Real-time Analysis During Proxy Requests**

   - Description: Analyze conversations as they happen during proxy requests
   - Pros: Immediate insights, no batch processing needed
   - Cons: Adds latency to requests, increases costs, harder to manage failures

2. **Dedicated Analysis Microservice**

   - Description: Separate service that pulls conversations and analyzes them
   - Pros: Complete isolation, independent scaling, technology flexibility
   - Cons: Complex deployment, data synchronization challenges, operational overhead

3. **Background Jobs in Proxy Service**

   - Description: Background workers within the proxy service using database polling
   - Pros: Simple deployment, shared database access, easier maintenance
   - Cons: Competes for proxy resources, requires careful resource management

4. **Event-Driven Lambda/Cloud Functions**
   - Description: Serverless functions triggered by conversation completion
   - Pros: Auto-scaling, pay-per-use, no infrastructure management
   - Cons: Vendor lock-in, cold starts, complex local development

## Decision

We will implement **Background Jobs in Proxy Service** with database polling for the initial implementation, with a clear migration path to a dedicated microservice if needed.

### Implementation Details

1. **Database Schema**:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE conversation_analyses (
       id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       conversation_id UUID NOT NULL,
       branch_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'main',
       status conversation_analysis_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
       model_used VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'gemini-2.5-pro',
       analysis_content TEXT,
       analysis_data JSONB,
       raw_response JSONB,
       error_message TEXT,
       retry_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
       generated_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
       processing_duration_ms INTEGER,
       prompt_tokens INTEGER,
       completion_tokens INTEGER,
       created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
       updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
       UNIQUE (conversation_id, branch_id)
   );
   ```

2. **Processing Strategy**:

   - Database polling with row-level locking
   - Configurable batch sizes and processing intervals
   - Exponential backoff for retries
   - Smart truncation for long conversations

3. **API Design**:

   ```typescript
   POST /api/analyses - Create analysis request
   GET /api/analyses/:conversationId/:branchId - Get analysis
   POST /api/analyses/:conversationId/:branchId/regenerate - Force regeneration
   ```

4. **Cost Management**:

   - Token counting before submission
   - Configurable limits per conversation
   - Message truncation strategies
   - Caching of analysis results

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Simple Deployment**: No additional infrastructure required initially
- **Shared Resources**: Reuses existing database connections and monitoring
- **Easy Migration Path**: Can extract to microservice when needed
- **Cost Effective**: Controlled processing with configurable limits
- **Flexible Analysis**: Supports multiple AI providers through configuration

### Negative

- **Resource Competition**: Background jobs compete with proxy traffic
- **Scaling Limitations**: Tied to proxy service scaling
- **Deployment Coupling**: Updates require proxy service restart

### Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: Background jobs impacting proxy performance

  - **Mitigation**: Configurable concurrency limits and resource monitoring
  - **Mitigation**: Circuit breakers to pause processing under high load

- **Risk**: Long-running analyses blocking other conversations

  - **Mitigation**: Timeout controls and conversation size limits
  - **Mitigation**: Priority queue implementation for fair processing

- **Risk**: High API costs from analyzing large conversations
  - **Mitigation**: Token counting and limits before API calls
  - **Mitigation**: Smart sampling for very long conversations
